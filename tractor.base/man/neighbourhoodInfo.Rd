\usage{
createNeighbourhoodInfo(width, dim = 3, centre = rep(0, dim))
}
\arguments{
\item{width}{An integer voxel width. Must be odd.}

\item{dim}{An integer giving the dimensionality of the neighbourhood.
Currently must be 3.}

\item{centre}{A numeric vector giving the centre voxel of the neighbourhood.
Must have exactly \code{dim} elements.}
}
\value{
\code{createNeighbourhoodInfo} returns a list with class
  \code{"neighbourhoodInfo"} and elements
  \describe{
    \item{width}{Copied from the \code{width} argument.}
    \item{dim}{Copied from the \code{dim} argument.}
    \item{centre}{Copied from the \code{centre} argument.}
    \item{vectors}{\code{dim} x \code{width^dim} matrix whose columns give
      the locations of each point in the neighbourhood.}
    \item{innerProducts}{A square, symmetric matrix of inner products
      between every location in the neighbourhood and every other.}
  }
}
\description{
This function calculates information about a cuboidal region of an image,
with a centre and a fixed voxel width.
