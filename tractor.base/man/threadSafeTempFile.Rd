\description{
This function is a wrapper around \code{\link{tempfile}}, which creates
temporary file names whose path contains the process ID of the calling
process. This avoids clashes between threads created by functions such as
\code{mclapply} (in the ``parallel'' package), which can easily occur with
the standard \code{\link{tempfile}} function.
