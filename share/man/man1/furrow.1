.TH "furrow" 1

.SH NAME
furrow \- Preprocessor for TractoR's session shorthand

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B furrow [\fB\-s \fIdir\fR] \fIcommand\fR [\fIarguments\fR]\fB
.br
.B furrow \-h

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBfurrow\fR program is a simple wrapper around the specified \fIcommand\fR, which replaces TractoR-style shorthand in the \fIarguments\fR with canonical paths, and then runs \fIcommand\fR. This allows third-party commands to be called in a way that is consistent with TractoR's session abstraction, without requiring the exact paths to individual images to be known.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h
Display usage information and quit.
.TP
.B \-s \fIdir\fB
Use the TractoR session hierarchy based in the specified directory, \fIdir\fR, as a default for path expansions. This allows 'dir@FA' to be abbreviated to just '@FA', which results in a more concise command when more than one image is referenced. The default is the current directory.

.SH EXAMPLES
This simple example prints the full path to the FA map within the test dataset shipped with TractoR.
.TP
.PP
furrow \-s $TRACTOR_HOME/tests/data/session echo @FA
.PP
Notice that certain shorthand, such as '@data', is ambiguous. In these cases subdirectory syntax is used to disambiguate, as in
.TP
.PP
furrow \-s $TRACTOR_HOME/tests/data/session echo @diffusion/data
.PP
Images that are not present in the session hierarchy will not currently be substituted for.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Return value is 1 if the substitution fails; otherwise it is the return value of \fIcommand\fR.
